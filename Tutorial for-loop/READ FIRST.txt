Welcome to Omar Diab's for-loop Python Tutorial!

To get started I will start off with the 
most basic for-loop.

First we need an array.

array = []

You can put whatever you like in this array.
I am going to put my favorite cars in this array

favoritecars = ['350z', 'Acura TL', 'Mercedes e63', 
'Infiniti', 'Gsxr', 'Corvette']

Now that we have our array we may now start the for-loop!

The structure of a for-loop is: for i in j:

The i is the element in the array and the j is the array itself.

So for my example, I would use: for car in favoritecars:

You must use the : at the end of the for loop for-loop
for python to be able to run it.

Now that we have the for-loop structured we can set it up
to be able to print it out in python using print().

Congradulations! You now have the basic knowldge of how to execute
a for-loop. The are many ways on how this is useful to use and I
will be showing you some example in python itself!
